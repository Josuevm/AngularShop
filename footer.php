                   <p>
                   Set forth below are descriptions of fees that may apply to your Spiral rental.</p>
                    <li><p><b>Early Return Fee:</b> Applies if you did not prepay your rental charges and returned the vehicle more than 24 hours early before the return time indicated in your rental agreement. You will only pay for the days used, but there will be a $25 charge to compensate us in part for our inability to rent your vehicle during the remaining time reserved for your use.
					</p></li>
					<li><p><b>Late Return Fee:</b> In addition to charging Additional Rental Days for a late return, we will charge a fee to compensate us in part for the costs we incur in finding an alternative vehicle to satisfy our next booking for your vehicle. This fee of $16 per day (maximum of 5 days) applies if you return your vehicle more than 12 hours after the scheduled return time.</p></li>


					<li><p><b>Return Change Fee:</b> Applies if you change the location and or date/time of your rental and proactively contact us by phone. There is a $10 fee to change your rental agreement.
               		Domestic Security Fee - The State of New Jersey enacted a Domestic Security Fee for a maximum of 28 days. This fee is effective on all motor vehicle rentals in the state of New Jersey. All car rental companies are required to collect and remit this fee to the State.</p></li>

					<li><p><b>Energy Surcharge</b> - Energy Surcharge – Separate and apart from the costs of fueling rental vehicles, energy costs represent a substantial portion of Spiral’s operating expenses.  To offset the significant costs of utility charges, bus fuel, oil and grease and related costs, Spiral is separately imposing an Energy Surcharge.  This Charge is not intended to reflect a precise measure of Spiral’s actual energy costs incurred to serve a particular customer</p></li>
